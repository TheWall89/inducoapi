A simple python module to generate OpenAPI Description Documents by supplying request/response bodies.

*Contributions for new features, fixes or improvements are welcome. Feel free to send a pull request.*

## Motivation

Sometimes you have a fully functioning HTTP service without OpenAPI documentation. At some point in time, others may
need to use your service. Writing the documentation by hand is a pain and can feel like an overwhelming job for complex
services.
*inducoapi* helps you generate your OpenAPI Description Documents by taking as input request/response examples plus some
other information.

The generated OpenAPI documentation is validated
with [openapi-spec-validator](https://github.com/p1c2u/openapi-spec-validator).

*Warning*: This program also generates the `example` fields in OpenAPI schemas by default. If you have sensitive data in
your request/response files, disable this feature with `--no-example`.

## Installation

### With `pip`

```shell script
pip install inducoapi
```

### With [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:TheWall89/inducoapi.git
cd inducoapi
poetry install
```

To run unit-tests:

```shell script
poetry run pytest
```

## Usage

### From CLI

`inducoapi` provides its own command. You can simply execute it with

```shell script
inducoapi
```

If you get a `command not found` error, try to activate your virtualenv or run `poetry shell` first.

You can also run `inducoapi` in the classic way:

```shell script
python -m inducoapi
```

#### Help

`inducoapi` provides its own help. Check it out with:

```shell script
python -m inducoapi -h
```

#### Examples

Let's consider a simple case: you have an HTTP service managing employees. We want to generate the OpenAPI Description
Document for a GET on all the employees, returning a 200 status code:

```shell script
python -m inducoapi GET /employees 200
```

<details><summary>output</summary>

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Generated by InducOapi
  version: v1
paths:
  /employees:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          description: ''
```

</details>

Now, a GET request with an empty response is not quite useful. Let's add an argument with a JSON file containing a
response example. Input examples can be found in [examples](examples).

```shell script
python -m inducoapi GET /employees 200 --response examples/employees.json
```

<details><summary>output</summary>

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Generated by InducOapi
  version: v1
paths:
  /employees:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          description: ''
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    id:
                      type: integer
                      example: 1
                    name:
                      type: string
                      example: Dwight Schrute
                    role:
                      type: string
                      example: salesman
```

</details>

Let's add a parameter to filter the employees by name.

```shell script
python -m inducoapi GET /employees 200 --response examples/employees.json --parameter name,query 
```

<details><summary>output</summary>

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Generated by InducOapi
  version: v1
paths:
  /employees:
    get:
      responses:
        '200':
          description: ''
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    id:
                      type: integer
                      example: 1
                    name:
                      type: string
                      example: Dwight Schrute
                    role:
                      type: string
                      example: salesman
      parameters:
        - name: name
          in: query
          required: false
          description: ''
          schema: { }
```

</details>

Finally, let's try a POST request with both request and response examples.

```shell script
python -m inducoapi POST /employees 201 --request examples/new_employee_req.json --response examples/new_employee_resp.json
```

<details><summary>output</summary>

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Generated by InducOapi
  version: v1
paths:
  /employees:
    post:
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                name:
                  type: string
                  example: Michael Scott
                role:
                  type: string
                  example: manager
      responses:
        201:
          description: ''
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  id:
                    type: integer
                    example: 4
                  name:
                    type: string
                    example: Michael Scott
                  role:
                    type: string
                    example: manager
```

</details>

If you want to directly write the generated OpenAPI Description Documents to a YAML file, just
add `--output openapi.yaml`

### From python

[test_inducoapi.py](tests/test_inducoapi.py) provides usage examples of the module from python.

## TODO list

- [x] Add support for request/response files in YAML
- [x] Add support for `application/yaml` content
- [x] Customize title and version in info
- [x] Package module
- [x] Support for `$ref` in response schemas
- [x] Add support for `parameters`
- [ ] ~~Add support for `links`~~ (I don't think it is very useful)
- [ ] ~~Add support for `format`~~ (hard to infer)
